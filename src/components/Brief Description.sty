Hey Kundan, 
So my approach for the project first was to quickly analyze the given structure/website layout. how it could be made efficiently both for mobile as well as desktop devices. 

This is the file structure for the project

- src
 - App.css
 - App.js
 - App.test.js
 - components
   - Content.jsx
   - Header.jsx
   - Sidebar.jsx
   - Studentsoncall.jsx
   - Youtube.jsx
 - index.css
 - index.js
 - reportWebVitals.js
 - setupTests.js
- public
 - images
   - study01.jpg
   - study02.jpg
- students.json
- tailwind.config.js


Given the time constrained i filtered out possiblities to make the best out of the given design within the tiime frame.
I first analyzed the sidebar and header of the website (starting from the basics).
Initially i had decided how i would structure or design the website like how where the divs will be placed so that when the screen is decreased or when other elements are introduced they are adjusted accordingly.

I assumed that this would be a e-learning platform where students could come and learn together from the teacher/tutor teaching them their respective topics. The studens attending the lecture could be any number so i decied to go with making json array for it. so that when it goes fullstack this approach would be efficient. the layout for video playback was perfect given in design.

I asssumed that the sidebar and the section bar which was given were buttons to navigate to other secitons of the app. I would be excited and love to make it also going ahead joining the team.
I all-in-all assumed the data like student's screen, videos could be dynamic so i tried to planned according simulataneously considering the fluid responsiveness of the website.


Waiting to hear from you.
Thank you.
